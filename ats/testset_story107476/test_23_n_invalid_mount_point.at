#	TORF-107476: As a LITP User i want my VM to mount a tmpfs
#	filesystem in order to facilitate Kafka persistence
#
#	Decription:
#		Test to verify that as a user i can't use the same
#		mount point as another nfs/tmpfs/ramfs mount
#
#	Steps:
#		1. Create nfs file system on a VM
#		2. Create vm-ram-mount item on a VM using the same
#		 mount point as the nfs file system
#		3. Create/ Run plan
#		4. Assert Validation error is received
#
#	Expected Result:
#		Validation error is received for using the same
#		mount point as the nfs mount
